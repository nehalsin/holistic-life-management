### Farming Management Counseling

Friends can combine from beginning. Organic cow based urine dung based farming. Visions are similar. Buy land adjacent to each other.

Three types of farming. Cow based is best. Then is chemical farming. Worst is organic farming. Importing of earthworm.  NPK mud becomes concrete. Porous. Life inside it. Then plant growth is dependent on chemical only. This is very dangerous. Organic is most dangerous. Poultry farm. Chemicals getting into poultry. Through that pesticides etc. Highest carbon footprint.

Traditional cow of traditional variety. One cow is sufficient for large area. Cow urine, dal, jaggery, soil below peepal tree. Jeevamrit. This is the culture. That's the right kind of micro organism. Proper produce. 

Nicely shaped fruits etc are not good. These are commercial produced. Natural will not be very beautiful.
