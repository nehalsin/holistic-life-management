# Seeking bliss: Manav, 42, a hobby traveler

_2022-05-18_

 1.  Live in present. Past and future do not exist. For example, can we bring back 1955? 
 2. Living in jungle but are on Facebook. Contradiction. Not fully in jungle then. Have met a lot of friends who live in jungle just the way they lived in urban settings. What's the point? 
 3. When you are in jungle why need tea? 
 4. Bliss first. We are always promised an uncertain future. But do we ever get bliss? 
 5. Just like in businesses dealings we go by the dictum "No debt", or better "Cash first" similarly in life practicalities we must go by "Bliss first". 
 6. We need to find an arrangement wherein bliss lies at core in the centre and daily chores revolve around spiritual core of bliss. 
 7. A word might be understood differently by different people. Using own definitions for others can lead to confusions. 
 8. _"We need to wear a watch or follow time by clock."_ We don't even have a watch! Clock is for industrial setups where we need to match routines with more people around. We sleep early, wake up early. We follow Nature's clock. (_Our own Natural Solar Routine (NSR) is all about time, clock and staying ahead of the curve!_)
