# Right philosophy is the crux:  Bonita ji - Vinay, mother son duo

 2022-03-16

 1.  Need, Want, Desire: Need as natural, whereas unnatural.  Desire is part of Want. Are you calling "Desire" "Luxury"? 
 2. Ghee. No real ghee available. 
 3. Water is need. Bisleri is want. 
 4. Normal vs Abnormal. Call it Average. Normal and Average mean different. 
 5. By way of advertisements, companies are converting wants into need. 
 6. No such thing as Slum. Incident. "What is Slum?" Where are you living yourself? Main location in the city. 
 7. Another incident: One girl said one can eat as much as they want in village, whereas quantity of food is fixed in city. 
 8. "Do people stay united in your area? Do people die of diseases in your area? Do people fight at your home? How many suicides in so called Slum?" Jugaad economy in slum. Two types of Slum. One is poor people slum, one is rich people slum. So cancel use of the word slum as redundant. No such thing as slum. 
 9. "What about suicides in slum? So who is better?" This was important dialogue with young gentleman. 
10. Music question 1: Gaayan and Beat need to go together. Timing needs correction. 
11. Inner dynamics. Singing and playing together. Both won't go wrong. Probability is less. Timing control support with harmonium. Mind body coordination. 
12. Valuable discussion on Zero Budget Life and concept of Empowerment. Empowerment is of mind, not by revolution on road. 
13. Healthy and right budget of food keeping in mind economies of time, effort and resources. Zero Budget Life Program is all about Need. 
14. Lowest human behaviour witnessed during Covid times 2021. 
15. A big farmer playing classical music for his cows. Care for animals and sensitivity for ecosystem. 
16. Babita ji needs Chakotra.
