# Meeting with Mohan ji 2022-02-06

Salient points of the session. 

_Mohan ji had taken up a contract at ceremony._ 

 1.  _"Sir what's your Introduction?"_ "What will you ask a bird? Bird would say, this is what I'm and show you natural flight. Our problem is that we want to understand or expect the bird to explain us it's being in terms of our understanding or language of air pressure, thrust, laws of mechanics etc and all other limited knowledge that we feel we have."
 2. _"Sir I want to let go. Someone near to me has left my life. All I gather from your talk that we must let go."_ (Then he was shown Bhagavad Gita 2.11.) "My father has left. Life is like a railway platform. People come and go. If you can, control it. If not, accept it and don't grieve." 
 3. As free from market as possible (**Zero Budget**) even while living in urban area. What do you think will be our complete expenditure for the month, including electricity, food, water, and all incidental charges. _Sir about 8k/- per month?_ No, we are aiming for 4k/- or even less than that per month. 
 4. You're a photographer. We are wearing same dress every day. If we compare ourselves with other people (regarding how we are dressed as compared to others in the occasion) then our happiness is controlled by other people. Be a star not a planet. 
 5. In this ceremony I'm from both the sides, yet you're the most important person in this wedding. It is highly possible that I'll go without eating anything from the wedding. 
 6. Whether we eat or not depends on our principles. 
 7. _"Sir you're full of life."_ "I don't live in the scarcity created by the monetary system. I live in abundance, in the lap of nature." 
 8. _"Are you a life coach?"_ "No, I just live life." 
 9. _"What can you guide me?"_ "Already in our talkin' a lot has been transmitted even though neither you know my name nor I know your name. Beauty of our interaction without worldly introduction is that we are exchanging our views spontaneously and freely without any worldly inhibition or consideration." 

## Brief Insights
 1. Freedom is reciprocal. 
 2. Being can't be imposed.
 3. Individuality. All leaves are different. All trees are right, no comparison.
 4. "You have to smile" is an imposition. Smile and the world smiles automatically with you.
 5. Full and final transaction. Uncertainty of future.
 6. Randomness of universe. Why fight? Embrace it.
 7. Full and final transaction. I share with you all what I have at this moment.
 8. Why bother to understand? Why worry about the karma principle? I have not seen rebirth or soul etc. Play in the lap of mother Nature. Impossible to understand tasting mechanism of sugar in order to experience the taste of sweet. Just be beyond mind.
 9. Creative person can't be sad. New leaves don't come on dead trees.
10. Blocking blocks yourself. 
11. Love (Prem) is directed towards happiness of beloved. Whereas expectation (Moha) is directed towards self gratification.
12. Love is beyond mind.
13. God or Creation or Existence or Universe loves us without any expectation.
14. Beloved eats food, I get satisfied even without eating anything at this grand function. I don't eat commercial food. If she forces me to eat or I force her not to eat, that would be a problem.
15. _"So what I was doing was not prem (love) it was moha (expectation)."_ Well this is your moment of Truth. You have realised yourself and have unblocked and liberated yourself.
16. Knowledge is futile. I don't know anything. Existence is infinite.
17. Respectful acceptance of the being of others is the basis for peaceful coexistence.
18. Don't bother about others at your own cost. We wear same clothes everyday, even at this formal function. It is what you are, not how you appear.
19. Ultimately solutions to own problems emerge from own self only.
20. Book knowledge is of use only to match with relevant experience. Only having traveled the land on foot, the map gives insights and overall perspectives.
