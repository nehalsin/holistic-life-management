### Loneliness

#### Asha
 1.  Social beings. 
 2. Being lonely may seem neurotic. 
 3. Confusion by reading different gurus. 
 
####  Significant Points
 3. What is **us** in practicality? 
 4. What people say, books also say that. 
 5. What is own definition of self. What is my being. Not to impress others. Not to speak on stage. 
 6. Jataka katha
 7.  Shrimadbhagawatam: Mother, father, wife, children, river, fish, insects, fire, air, etc ownership. After thinking too much that's the only question who's body it is? 
 8. Own definition to be defined by ownself. 
 9. Famous institution. Big Prof. Son had mental problem. Power placement. What we know and what we understand is the most important. Son big in size. Pathetic to watch son. Could be IQ question too. If someone would ask would you want to be son of that guy? He is what he does not know. He is asking 50/-, 10/-. We can't scold him. 
10. Basis of any question meaning: हमारी क्या अस्मिता है? Asmita means identity in Sanskrit. अहम् कः? 
11. If question of identity is settled then other questions are also settled. 
12. Dhyan beech mazaar mein. Popular quote.
13. Level mismatching. Sometimes can be deliberate. 
14. We live in own consciousness. 
15. Difference between success and happiness. 
16. Bangalore is place of success. Why is it suicide capital? EQ problem. 
17. Suicide was not due to failure in big institutions like IIT. Identity issue. Question of identity biggest? Ego. 
18. What am I seeing? What is my world? 
19. Are you at peace with yourself or not? 
20. Identity crisis. The moment you know what you're then you're at peace with yourself. 
21. Cannot know identity by reading books. Cannot jump that way. 
22. Blissful state. No dependence.
23. Both extremes are bad. One is no dialogue. Other is start talking to walls. Etc. 
24. Difference between BhagavadGita and Shrimadbhagawatam. 
25. Knowledge and peace are not same. Veda Vyasa story at banks of River Saraswati. 
26. Paramhansa. Understands Maya and Truth difference. Kaakvishtha. The moment you know divine then there's nothing except it. 
27. Navdhabhakti. 9-fold devotion. Then Shrimadbhagawatam was written.  Shukdeva narrated. Exposition of Bhakti. 18000 verses. Bhagavat Puran. 12 cantos/Skandh. Ekadash Skandh. Eknathi Bhagavat Maharashtra. 
28. Pingla Vaishya story. Dejection and desperation. Asha hi paramamdukham. Nairashyam hi paramamsukham.  Karm phal bandhan. Nairashyam. Detached. Easier said than done. Many kathayein like this in Bhagavat. Similar emotions with all. 
29. Mahabharata. Conflict between society and divine. 
30. Shrimadbhagawatam.
31. Titikshu Brahman ki katha. 
32. Take out the important points out of kathas. 
33. Distress -> Disenchantment -> Gyan Agni prajvalit
34. Identity in dream is different. 
35. Relativity. How does it matter? Intellectualism. **Tark ke vitark**. Problem with intellectualism. Read less. Don't get involved with intellectualism. What have you understood? Live in it. **Introspection and self reflection**. Difference between introspection (totally internal) and self reflection (relates to relation with world). 
36. Definitions of terms before essay writing. 
37. Write about journey. 
38. Vidya ki parakashtha. Vinay ki parakashtha. 
39. Scientific language. Mathematical. How come too much knowledge in Sanskrit? Hindi is varnsankar. Hybrid. Compromise. 
40. Can't call vikriti as navachar. 
41. Panini standardization. 
42. Objective analysis of Sanskrit. 
43. 7.2 million Sanskrit manuscripts still left. Sharda lipi. Kashmir. 13-14 know it. Brahmi lipi. 
44. **Sanskrit as core in understanding.** 
45. **Cannot ignore Sanskrit.**
46. "Got direction after talking." What direction? 
47. Anvaya Padchhed is not interpretation. 
48. No one can translate. 
49. Organizations like Iskcon. Has direction. Has agenda. 
50. "One fine day." Told by Asha. 
51. **If not me then who. If not now then when.** 

#### Actionable Points

1. Write love letters to ownself. Have dialogue with ownself.
2. Eknathi Bhagavat. Maharashtra. Shrimadbhagawatam. Read Shrimadbhagawatam completely. Read like a novel only. Gitapress. Only Hindi. Sanskrit/Hindi both. 
3. Ekadash Skandh. 
4. Anvaya Padchhed Gitapress

### Asha 

What is Grace? 

Disgrace. 

### Points of discussion

Questions given to Asha. 

What is disgrace? 

What is culture? 

Actual grace is never disgrace. 
Can't do anything about it. 

World's grace is of no use. 

There is nothing other than grace. 

Close, similar, almost. So many gaps. **Approximations**. Margin of error. 

No disgrace. 
**Talkin' about absolute.** 

**Grace exists.** 
**Rest is dust.**

No meanings of words. Dictionary meaning different.
