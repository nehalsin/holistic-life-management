### Plan
Registered decades ago. Two rooms. Winter already there. Havana happen. Mandir also established. Online presence. Google map.  Narmadeshwar Mahadeva Temple. Shiv Parivar. Photos will be sent. Not in immediate focus. Gram Udyog. 

1) Pathar ki ShivLing. 
2) Moorti Sthapit. 

Mandir Development. 150 metres away. This is correct as per Vaastu. Shadow of temple should not fall on any house. Technological and astrological point. 

Shiva Linga to be removed from there and should be replaced. Father needs to approve. Father will approve when there are resources. 

Two-Four people can sit on that rock for meditation.
