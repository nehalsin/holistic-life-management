HLM over Bhagavat Gita

 1.  _Which Bhagavat Gita to be read by a specific person?_ We  first ask them their experience with Gita and books they have read, after which we can conclude right book to be gifted or recommended. 
 2.  We never tell a person to read Bhagavat Gita. We just relate to an event in the person's life with relevant Gita shloka, show them, and after that it's the person's journey. 
 3. Which book have your read? _I have heard about Bhagavat._ Now I know which Gita to suggest.
 4. _The way we see God, god also sees us in that way._ This is given in Bhagavat Gita 4.11.
 5.  Verse read from ANVAYA PADCCHED to realise importance of right pronunciation, necessity of grammar rules, rules come from Nature and not vice versa.
 6.  When a person is able to heartily relate to a particular verse in Bhagavat Gita then that book becomes their book instead of looking like a far fetched unattainable dream of spirituality. 
 7. What is enforced is religion what comes naturally is spirituality. So read as much as you can without thinking that each day one chapter needs be read. 
 8. _Who knows whether Mahabharata actually happened?_ That is immaterial whether it happened or not. Bhagavat Gita talks about framework not event. Whether you trade tomatoes or potatoes, your business model or accounts discipline remains a framework that is independent of actual transactions! 
 9. _When a relative came from south he arrived with Christian rosary and complete transformed look! I didn't appreciate that. He wasn't doing anything of that sort back here. _
 10. What is enforced is not permanent, what is understood or realised remains lifelong.
 11. We are into the spiritual work by means of knowledge representation and knowledge process. Gita contains formulae whereas the Bhagavat is explanation of Gita by the way of captivating stories. Both compositions are by Vedavyasa, both comprise of verses and message of Lord Krishna.
 12. You have been given a complete packages where in one book you hav verses for correct pronunciation and meaning, Gita Anvaya Padchhed; in the other you have relevant explanation, Gita Prabodhini. 
 13. _People rarely understand Gita._ Yes, this is given in Gita 7.3. 
 14. You can simply browse through these Gita books, note down verses you like and discuss these with us whenever we meet next! :)
