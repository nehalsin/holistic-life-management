# Practical Spirituality in Daily Life

## Divine Evolution Lila

In everyday Lila (play) our spirit is constantly aspiring for peace, truth and Bliss as evident by pondering over inner meaning of our daily banner, the so called trivia or routine expressions.

Divine blesses us to see Divine in each and every interaction, experience and expression of the so called mundane existence. Srimadbhagavatam is all about playing in the constant shower of nectar in the ocean of nectar.

We can see this as a very common everyday experience that each one undergoes almost every day or even several times during the day.

This is the often frustratingly experienced, standard impossibility of communication due to difference in the levels of consciousness. 

Divine realization by Divine grace is the only deliverance or Nirvana from this everyday predicament.

During introspection and self reflection for self purification and realization, we can immensely benefit by noting crude expressions of our own inner light that cracks open to flash out as our intense expressions on a routine basis and their step by step purification till we reach their ultimate pure form in the scriptures.

Once we do this, with a little effort, we immediately start realizing that scriptures are the ultimate pure and complete expressions of our true innermost self. At that point of no return, we start merging in the Divine consciousness also known as Nirvana.

Let us see this as the following real life example between family members.

### Spark of realization (crude form)

"In ka wahi raag hai sach batao par sachh bardasht nahi hai" (Hindi)

They have same old habit, tell them the truth, yet they can't tolerate the truth.


### Summary (general and refined form) by a fellow companion on the path of self purification and realization

Same with the whole world, the truth has been repeatedly told in Gita, SB etc, yet people don't see and live in the realization of Truth.

See Divine even in wicked.

### Ultimate complete expression as Bhagavat Dharma - Srimadbhagavatam Canto 11

ब्रह्मणे पुल्कसे स्तेने ब्रह्मण्येऽर्के स्फुलिंग के।
अक्रूरे क्रूरके चैव समदृक् पंडितो मतः।।
अर्थः
ब्राह्मण और अन्त्यज (जाति); चोर और साहु (कर्म); सूर्य और चिनगारी (गुण); कृपालु और क्रूर (स्वभाव)- इन विषम वस्तुओं को जो समदृष्टि से देखता है, उसे ‘पंडित’ कहते हैं।
